        This website is both a record of my journey through the <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/">Enspiral Dev Academy's</a> (EDA) 
        foundations curriculum and a live test of my skills as a fledgling web developer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As I progress through this course it will grow with new articles for both the 
        technical and cultural blogs. The technical blog will showcase new aspects and 
        understandings on my learnings as I progress through the foundation sprints. Whereas 
        the cultural blog will capture my views and reflections as a student and person 
        kicking off with Identity and values as these things normally do.

          <h2>Sprint 4 - My experiences with JavaScript</h2>
          <p>
            In this week's sprint we were asked to practice, practice and do a little more 
            practice with JavaScript. It was focused around introducing new (or newish) 
            principles, as well as doing coding katas. Yes katas, just like martial arts but 
            with repetitive coding practice. We were then asked to share some of our personal 
            stories on this blog post so here goes!
          </p>
          <h3>What simple problem did I get blocked on?</h3>
          <p>
            Da bees, da damn bees. It was an interesting problem taking a bunch of sentences 
            (strings for those technically minded) filled with buzzâ€™s and removing them to 
            filter out the annoying bee sounds. I pondered over ...

          <h2>Sprint 4 - Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset</h2>
          <p>
          For this sprint we touch on two concepts we are all familiar with even if we have 
          never used the terms listed here, these are Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset. 
          If you have ever done anything  with a steep learning curve, that requires lots of 
          repetition like learning to dance, or martial arts (or weapon based martial arts 
          like me) you will be on intimate terms with the concepts that these principles 
          highlight.
          </p>
          <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
          <p>Neuroplasticity is a concept based around the brain (your brain, my brain, 
            everyone's brain) being a malleable organ that is constantly strengthening 
            and recycling ...
