        This website is both a record of my journey through the <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/">Enspiral Dev Academy's</a> (EDA) 
        foundations curriculum and a live test of my skills as a fledgling web developer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As I progress through this course it will grow with new articles for both the 
        technical and cultural blogs. The technical blog will showcase new aspects and 
        understandings on my learnings as I progress through the foundation sprints. Whereas 
        the cultural blog will capture my views and reflections as a student and person 
        kicking off with Identity and values as these things normally do.

            in a non-technical friendly way. That and packing it with analogies too, so let's 
            see if mine are at least a little entertaining.

          <h3>HTML and CSS what's the difference?</h3>
          <p>
            The difference between HTML and CSS is that they are responsible for different 
            parts of the website. HTML is the blueprint for the websites it's skeletal 
            structure, sure it includes a lot of the content and all its listed parts but only 
            in its rawest form. CSS on the other hand is the look.

          <p>Emotional intelligence  as the dictionary meaning gose is “the capacity to be 
            aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal
