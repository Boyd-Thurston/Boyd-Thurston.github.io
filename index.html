        This website is both a record of my journey through the <a href="https://devacademy.co.nz/">Enspiral Dev Academy's</a> (EDA) 
        foundations curriculum and a live test of my skills as a fledgling web developer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As I progress through this course it will grow with new articles for both the 
        technical and cultural blogs. The technical blog will showcase new aspects and 
        understandings on my learnings as I progress through the foundation sprints. Whereas

        kicking off with Identity and values as these things normally do.

            isn't worth talking about, what is are the ways of positioning that give us more 
            control and do something outside of the norm. This is where we with a little bit
