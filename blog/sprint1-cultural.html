        <h2 id="section1">What is my personality type</h2>
        <p>
          I found a nice myers briggs personality test on line at 
          <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/">16personalities</a>
          , I have done similar before however this one is the first to resanate so much 
          with me. My previous attempts with these personality types caused me to question 
          there effectivness with how the discriptions of the results did not fit, this one 
          however feels bang on. It could be that this is a better version however I don't 
          beleave the therory behind them has been updated since developed by Isabel Briggs 
          Myers in the 40's and 50's. The honest reallity is more likely just that honestty. 
          To be effective your answers need to be honest so first you need to be honest 
          with your self, something I have been working on quite a bit lately.
        </p>
        <p>
          So what was the result? Drum roll please .... INFP-T aka the Mediator
        </p>
        <p>
          The user friendly terms have changes over time (refered to as the deplomat, the 
          visonary, the dove ect. on other versions) however the lettering is the part 
          that actually comes from the original myers briggs research. The T is an 
          interesting point which I will get to later.
        </p>

        <h2 id="section2">What does it mean</h2>
        <p>
          What does it all mean I hear you ask, well that is up for interpritation. So far 
          my research is starting to take form and personally make sense. The key aspect 
          of this personality type is its ability to see things from others prospective, to 
          see the good in everyone and everything, to find hope and try to fix it. Filled 
          with creativity and insperation which is however controdicted as this type of 
          personality also sits on the introverted side of the scale. This controdiction 
          and the rearity of this personality type (the website I used claims it makes up 
          less the 4% of the worlds population) lead to it being miss understood. The 
          information goes further into another controdiction with mediators having a 
          telent for communication and self expression, however with a tendancey to hide 
          away from the world when life goes wrong even to the extent of withdrawing to the 
          point of a hermit (presonally I have lived this controdiction so I can see where 
          this research has come from). Another point which resonated was the visonary 
          rebel with a cause, not challanging the system for the sake of anarchy but for a 
          good reason to make things better, the grater good and all that. They even reach 
          the point where they give themselves so fully to the cause that they forget to 
          focus on day-to-day living (again something that I have lived also). The miss
          understood nature of this personality type also flows to the perception of group 
          conversations, initily seen as shy or just introverted it is often missed that 
          INFP's generally listen first and intently so while being "shy" for the first 
          bit/couple of times in interactions they are actually collating data, figuring it 
          out and will come out with there point of view when it is time to put it forward 
          and it will be detailed, indepth even leading if they beleave your idea is almost 
          there but not quite. The biggest mistake you can make while dealing with this 
          personality type and my self specificaly is to assume that being quiet means that 
          we are quiet people, quite the oposite we/I will talk your ear off when there is 
          value to add.
        </p>
        <p>
          That last one is a bit funny actually not in a humorus way more in a realisation 
          of my own habbits kind of way. My self I have always though of my personality is 
          more of a crusaider for the grater good. Not a religous fanatic like the knights 
          templar, more of the same fervor but the belife is in soical justice and equality. 
          I am that guy that always plays the paladin in a D&D game, chooses to help the 
          good NPCs ect. In recent years I became some what political IRL but that didn't 
          go down well with everyone as you can imagine. Queue my lateset withdrawal from 
          the world which comes with an healthy/unhealthy dose of soul searching now to 
          follow what I want for a change, my own cause so to speak. Just a small one, 
          become a web developer and use my expression in a more benifical way.
        </p>
        <p>
          ... that beeing said my mind already wanders ... I see more that could be added 
          ...... web accessability ....... now there is part of the idea that I can still 
          add a bit of equality to my work ......... and that type of thinking is the 
          reason I can not put values out of my mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          That brings me to the next point taken from the research, and the T from the 
          personality type which stands for turbulent. If you couldn't guess my personality 
          type is governed by their values even ruled by them hence beinging able to lose 
          ones self in a cause. A turbulent Mediator is more likely to lose themselves than 
          an ascertive Mediator. It's an interesting personality querk that can be both a 
          strength and a weakness. We would all agree that being passionate is a good thing 
          however being zealious is not, both come from the same source the difference is 
          the intensity. Something I have known about my self for a long time (which this 
          research supports) is that I need to whatch how much I am letting my self commit 
          to something, its something I need to keep in check and something I have both 
          succeded at and compettly failed at in the past. Just another of lifes greate 
          balancing acts just with a more personal theme.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for discribing the culter that has influenced and molded my personality there 
          really is not enogth space in this blog to delve into detial. Lets just say I 
          take the good and the bad as experiances, all are part of me but not at the same 
          time. It's not so much what the experiance is but what you learnt from it and how 
          you react to them. If you didn't react well it is now history but as life seems 
          to have a habit of doing there will be more chances to react to experiances later. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="section3">Other INFP's</h2>
        <p>
          Before talking about me some more there was one little cute part of the 
          16personalities website where they listed some real people and fictional 
          characters the show case the traits of the same personality type. For the INFP's 
          that puts use in the company of createve gunieuses such as J.R.R Tolken, William 
          Shakespear, Jonny Depp etc. and fictional characters like Fox Mulder from the 
          x-files and Frodo Baggins form the Lord of the Rings (actually a few Tolken 
          characters made the list... write what you know I guess). It's cute but it does 
          put an enphasis on the creativity and passionate aspects of the personality type.
        </p>

        <h2 id="section4">Strenghts</h2>
        <h3>To summerise strengths:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Idelistic
          </li>
          <li>
            Createve
          </li>
          <li>
            Open minded and flexable
          </li>
          <li>
            Passionate
          </li>
          <li>
            Dedicated
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How these will assist my learning:</h3>
        <p>
          One of the outcomes of the combination of these strengths is that you can gain a 
          unique perspective about a problem and are able to see things in different ways 
          (more often than not in multipul ways simaltaniously) it is an asset for problem 
          solving. Not only does this work on an individual level but on a group level as 
          well, with taking others ideas working them through side by side and seeing how 
          they can be woven togeather.
        </p>

        <h2 id="section5">Weaknesses</h2>
        <h3>To summerise weaknesses:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            sometimes too Idelistic
          </li>
          <li>
            sometimes too Altruistic
          </li>
          <li>
            sometimes impractical
          </li>
          <li>
            Difficult to Get to Know
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What will I have to look out for in my learning:</h3>
        <p>
          as I have talked about a bit thus far the balance of the mix of personality 
          trates is key and it is a constant effort to not go too over the top with ideas, 
          care too much about a project and so forth.
        </p>
  
        <h2 id="section6">Making Fun at Behavioural Interviews</h2>
        <p>
          This assignment actually asked a couple of STAR question aka a behavoural 
          question. If you have been to a job interview in the last decade you would know 
          the type, so for the fun of it lets pretend this is an interveiw, here goes ...
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Interviewer</b> - This first question is about ethics and making ethical 
          decisions. Tell me of a time when you had to make an ethical decison. how did 
          you make your decsion and what was the outcome?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Candidate</b> - In my last role I had to make effical decisions on a dayly 
          bases, mainly around how hard to push collection of debt. On one hand you had the 
          customers that did not have the financial means to do so (or the desire). On the 
          other hand you had clients that need the support that these funds generate and 
          the financail or health needs that not haveing the funds. The ethical decision is 
          who do you help more the customer or the client.
        </p>
        <p>
          How I dealt with this was to gain more infromation about the customer and their 
          situation (already knowing the importance of the clients situation). Some where 
          having dificulty, some where causing their own difficulty, others should just not 
          be trading at all. Generally you got a feel for how people reasponded to your 
          questioning what is the best course of action.
        </p>
        <p>
          There where cases when we had to start proceedings to put customers into 
          insolvencey under the idea that constaintly getting further and further into debt 
          was bad for everyone involved not to mention the economy as a whole. There where 
          thankfully more situations that you could work with the customers negotiating on 
          some extra time to allow them to keep trading in the future and keep funding the 
          scheme that benifits the clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Interviewer</b> - This next question is about working togeather in a stressful 
          situation. Tell me about a time when you were trying to work productively with 
          others, but there was resistance or tension. What strategies you used, how 
          effective where they?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Candidate</b> - In a previous team there were two of us that were considerd 
          subject matter experts (SME's) however we had very differing styles in how we 
          provided information to other team members, so different in fact that we would 
          get frustrated with how the other would explain situations. The competting styles 
          where mine which revlolved around explaining the why and how of a situation so 
          the other could learn they way of thinking so they could resolve issues like this 
          in future. the other individuals styles was based on quick wins, giving the 
          answer only quickly under the idea that no matter how many times the same 
          question gets asked others will eventually get it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It became apparent that we could not continue under the current situation, so I 
          requested a one on one meeting. We discussed the and the frustrations. We also 
          discussed the merits of the qucik win and the educating approach our working 
          environment. We came to an agreement that we would split the work based upon need.
        </p>
        <p>
          The outcome was if the team member needed quick information to get strait back to 
          the customer say if they had been waiting a while or had to go through multiple 
          request to hold while the team member asked different questions from us then the 
          qucik win approach would be used. However if the situation had not been resolved 
          in multiple calls, or the team member had ask the same question more than one 
          then the education approach would be taken.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Interviewer</b> - If you were in that situation again, would you do any thing 
          different?
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Candidate</b> - Ask for the one on one meeting sooner, planing the course of action 
          made everything run smoother from then on.
        </p>
        <h2>Thank You!</h2>
        <p>
          If you made it this far thank you, I know it was a long one. Cheers for giving it a read.
