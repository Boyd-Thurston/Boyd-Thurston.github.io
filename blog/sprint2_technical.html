        <h2>CSS Positioning</h2>
        <p>CSS uses positioning to layout all of the bits a pieces that make up a web page. 
          Even when no code has been specified CSS still uses static positioning, that is 
          the normal way a pages pieces sit together. Being normal isn't that exciting and 
          isn't worth talking about, what is are the ways of positioning that give us more 
          control and do something outside of the norm. This is where we with a little bit 
          of extra code absolute, fixed and relative positioning comes into play.</p>
        
        <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>
        <p>
          What absolute positioning does is that it takes elements(a technical name given 
          to things that make up the page) out of the flow of the page, being ignored by 
          and ignoring other elements on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
          An absolute positioned element appears on the page depending on coordinates set 
          in its code top, bottom, left etc. If you think of it as an absolute positioned 
          element as a boy scout trying to find its way on a map with only a couple of 
          grid coordinates A1 utmost top left coordinate in the grid in code terms would 
          relate to top: 0; left: 0; so quite straightforward thus far what is really 
          interesting is what an absolute positioned element considers the map.
        </p>
        <p>
          To determine what the "map" is, our boy scout absolute positioned element first 
          looks for another type of positioned element to tell it what its boundary is. In 
          technical terms this would be an element set to relative positioning that its code
           has been written inside of, or for our hypothetical example think of this as a 
           scout leader telling our boy scout where he can and can't go for this exercise 
           effectively giving him a smaller map within this boundary. In CSS terms this means 
           the element will be positioned within the parent element (scout leader's map). For 
           example the title of this blog post is an absolute positioned element given a set 
           of coordinates to site in the correct place within the boundaries of the image at 
           the top of the page its relative positioned parent element.
        </p>
        <img class="in-article-img" src="../images/sp2-t4-blog-figure1.PNG" alt="absolute positioning example">
        <p>
          Now what if there is no relative positioned parent element, no scout leader, what
           does our boy scout do then? It does what any child given an out of context 
           instruction does what they think the instruction meant and as in real life this 
           does not always work out well. In our orienteering scenario the absolute positioned 
           element assumes We meant the whole page is the map regardless of where we put it in 
           the code of the document. In the context of this page layout if we removed the 
           position: relative; code line from the image at the top then the title would position 
           itself on the page as a whole. This would display partially covering the same part of 
           the page as the logo at the top left and over part of the navigation bar. This would 
          look like a mess.
        </p>

        <h2>Relative Positioning</h2>
        <p>
          As you can see from above you can not talk about absolute positioning without going 
          into relative positioning. Apart from being "relative" to an absolute positioned 
          child element providing it with the boundaries that it can use to decide on its 
          position it is also "relative" to the element it is set inside of, as well as 
          "relative" to the other elements inside of it. I know that's a lot of relatives 
          almost a family reunion going on here, let's think of it in a practical way.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we discussed the image earlier, and I am sorry to say but simplicity's sake I 
          lied. It is actually an invisible box around the image that both the title and 
          the image sit inside. Think of it as putting two different sized photos in the 
          same picture frame. They are both encased inside but it does more than just hold 
          them in it also keeps its shape it doesn't stretch or contract with the size of 
          the screen it well stays "relative".
        </p>
        <img class="in-article-img" src="../images/sp2-t4-blog-figure2.PNG" alt="absolute positioning example">
        <p>
          Try resizing the window you are viewing this in you see that the image and title 
          stay about the same in relation to each other. On the other hand look at the 
          copyright information below them. This is outside the invisible box, do you see 
          how it starts to look a bit wired at curtin sizes?
        </p>

        <h2>Fixed Positioning</h2>
        <p>
          By now you would have noticed that the navigation bar at the top of the page is 
          following you. No it's not a stalker is a fixed positioned element. A fixed 
          positioned element is fixed or attached to the same position on the screen. It 
          functions similar to our absolute positioned element earlier in that it has its 
          set of map coordinates but for a fixed position element there is no searching for 
          a parent element to tell it what to do. It already knows what to do its a fixed 
          positioned element it has a job and that job is to find its coordinates on your 
          screen (viewport in technical jargon) then stay there until it's told otherwise 
          and its good at its job.
        </p>

        <h2>More to know</h2>
        <p>
          There is more to positioning than these three (four if you include static 
          positioning) types of positioning. There are others like sticky positioning, 
          z-index ect. this is however not covered in this post maybe another time. 
          Thanks for reading.
