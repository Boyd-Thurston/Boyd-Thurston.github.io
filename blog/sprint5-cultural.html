        <p>
          For the last sprint of foundations the cultural blog is a double whammy. Firstly, 
          you have reflections on the core skills learnt over five weeks along with a 
          journal entry challenge, secondly you have the learning from the technical skills 
          over the whole foundation. So, without further ado, let's kick it off with the 
          journal exercise, a 2min rant by yours truly. With the lead in statement "What 
          surprised me the most about learning core is..." so lets start in 3,2,1 ..
        </p>

        <h2 id="section1">The Journal Exercise</h2>
        <p>
          What surprised me the most about learning core is the adaptability of the skills 
          learnt in this section. Pretty much all of which are life skills, and although 
          some are just part of being professional, somewhat surprising to be taught by an 
          IT academy. I think the parts about mindfulness, being kind to yourself and the 
          growth mindset are all about the fact that although programing is fun and 
          creative, it can also be mind boggling and frustrating when things just don’t go 
          the way that you want. A lot of this topic is about knowing yourself so you can 
          be the best and deliver the best, not push yourself to deliver something that is 
          not of high quality because you got so stressed making it you missed out 
          something basic. There are quite a few more things I could say about this but I’m 
          out of time already. For me, that's actually quite a small rant for two minutes. 
        </p>

        <h2 id="section2">Core Skills Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          The next part of the first part, part one, part two or is it really three parts 
          out of two exercises … anyhow back on track, this section is a Q&A. 
        </p>
        <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I really am too altruistic, this has caused me to lose out on many an 
          occasion. It's all well and good wanting to be helpful and going the extra mile, 
          but there is a point when you need to ask yourself is it not more helpful to let 
          people help themselves or should you really be doing this.
        </p>
        <p>
          My crazy amount of asking questions isn’t a bad thing, it's a really good thing 
          most of the time. I have just been trying to fit into somewhere where my 
          personality just doesn’t fit … yes “..will you pay that by credit card?” I am 
          talking to you (in joke for debt collectors).
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly, having more breaks isn’t skiving off, as long as they are quick and you 
          get back on task after they actually make you perform better. 
        </p>

        <h3>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p>
          Values are important in everything, especially if you are in the business of 
          making ethical decisions. Intellectual property rights, privacy and security are 
          the big three when it comes to IT but they are definitely important. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Empathy is a big thing as I see it, and that's empathy not sympathy. There is a 
          huge difference between the two. Empathy is effectively gathering and 
          understanding data on social interactions in the moment they are happening, it’s 
          information that you can use to guide your reactions/further interactions. It's 
          like getting a feel for something before you make a choice. Sympathy is where you 
          feel bad for someone in a situation, it’s the little brother of guilt even if you 
          paid no part in the situation itself. The problem with sympathy is it leads you 
          to make decisions without all the information and let's face it, we are human and 
          that kind of thinking can go wrong very quickly. I may have lost the plot again 
          there for a bit so I will summarise, in short, empathy lets you get along with 
          other people/students/coworkers without being an ass. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Self awareness, well have you ever heard the saying burning the candle at both 
          ends? Sure you have and when it comes to learning, for me that springs to mind 
          every time someone talks about being self aware. It's the idea of pushing 
          yourself until you’re no use to anyone when you could have just known when to 
          step back, take a breath and start again when your mind is at ease. 
        </p>

        <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I pretty much covered that in the journal exercise above, I will say it again 
          though. The core skills covered in this course are not industry specific 
          competencies, they are life skills. Life skills that are needed in employment and 
          social situations alike. The most surprising thing to say about it is that they 
          are packed into this course whereas other IT courses they don’t really play a 
          part. I am not one to make statements before I have information to back them up 
          but it does look as if EDA’s commitment to get you ready to be employed after the 
          course is more than just words. 
        </p>

        <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p>
          That's an easy one, it is sharing my thoughts and feelings with almost complete 
          strangers while my inner critic is saying “that garbage, who in their right mind 
          would want to read that?” to which I now reply “ssssssssssh”.
        </p>

        <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>
          Again covered earlier, I get the feeling these questions are trying to get a 
          point across by asking it on multiple levels. That point being life skills are 
          important and there is a commitment to be ready for employment at the end of this 
          course.
        </p>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p>
          Again the same point, yet another way of asking it. Let's put it another way, you 
          could be the best programmer in the world and be an asshole or you could be an ok 
          programmer but be easy to get along with and take direction. If I was an employer 
          I would normally pick the ok programmer especially if I had to spend any decent 
          length of time with them. If you can't show empathy people generally don't like 
          partnering up with you, there goes that pair programing method they touched on in 
          this sprint. Not to mention, if you don’t know how to work around frustration 
          when things just aren’t working the way you envisioned you will never succeed as 
          a programmer.
        </p>

        <h2 id="section3">Learning Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Next comes the learning reflections and it is another Q&A:
        </p>

        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>
          For me it's simple, it's a lifestyle choice as well as a career path. I want to 
          be able to use both hemispheres of my brain at the same time and programing is 
          something I seem to get and enjoy doing. There was one piece of advice I got a 
          long time ago that I never listened to that was “If you do what you enjoy you 
          never have to work a day in your life” as for the goals they read like this:
        </p>
        <p>
          Step 1 - learn, learn and learn some more.<br>Step 2 - get into the industry.<br>
          Step 3 - enjoy doing what I love, frustrations and all. It's all part of it.
        </p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>
          For strengths I would say coming at a problem sideways, to elaborate: approach a 
          problem from many different angles and keep coming up with ideas on how to 
          approach things better. As for limitations the inner critic will need to be 
          silenced. Plus there is always the joy of being dyslexic - copy and paste may be 
          a good work around sometimes but not for coding and being able to spell a word 
          three different ways in the same sentence also doesn’t help with coding, I am 
          going to need to learn new coding specific work arounds.
        </p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
        <p>
          Spelling fits into both technical and non-technical, what was that old quote “I 
          have no respect for a man who can spell a word only one way?” (even if it's never 
          been proven to have been said by Mark Twain) . It really doesn’t help with coding 
          nor others perception on your intellect. It's amazing how much emphasis people 
          put on spelling and vocabulary when it comes to deciding if someone is smart or 
          not. 
        </p>

        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
        <p>
          Confidence in my ability … well more solid confidence, I wouldn’t be here if I 
          didn’t think success was a chance, I do second guess myself far too often.
        </p>

        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          A lot of fast paced work, where I will learn modern coding techniques and most 
          importantly put them into practice.
