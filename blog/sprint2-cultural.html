      <p>This sprints cultural blog article calls for a Q&A session, some of them are quite 
        tricky so here goes...</p>

      <h2 id="section1">What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>As a learner yet to enter the industry, my career goal is to simply enter the 
        industry as a web developer. To expand on this concept further, to also be 
        successful as web developer, after achieving that, who knows what the future holds? 
        I may hone my skills further and continue down the path of a web developer for the 
        rest of my working career, or I may branch out into other forms of development 
        maybe software, games etc. As long as I stay true to my creativity and continue to 
        strive for challenge I think I will be fine.</p>

      <h2 id="section2">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in 
        yourself while at EDA?</h2>
      <p>Non-technical skills, human skills, soft skills, many names for the same concept, 
        how do you manage yourself and how do you handle interactions with others. These 
        are skills that you need to constantly develop as the only constant in life is 
        change. If I had to choose one of two to specifically work on right now it would be 
        time management and lasting rapport. Not that I do not already possess these skills, 
        more that they need to adapt to my changing situations. I have spent so so so many 
        years collecting debt and talking to customers on a transactional basis that I 
        would be kidding myself If I didn’t believe that I adapted to that methodology, 
        managing time on a call by call basis rather than being master of my own clock, 
        building rapport over one or a couple of conversations without real lasting contact 
        (who wants to be a repeat client of the same debt collector?).</p>

      <h2 id="section3">How would you describe your own strengths and limitations?</h2>
      <p>As I touched on in the last sprints cultural blog post 
        <a href="sprint1-cultural.html">Identity and Values</a>, my strengths are my weaknesses 
        and my weaknesses are my strengths. A creative creature that is a wellspring of 
        inspiration and ideas, however I can get lost in the ideas, coming up with a score 
        of new ideas before finishing the first. I never get stuck for inspiration, more 
        spoilt for choice, and choosing can sometimes be tricky.</p>

      <h2 id="section4">Based on the above description, how you will manage your workload in this 
        programme? This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to 
        work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and 
        industry/community representatives.</h2>
      <p>Wow what a question, where do I begin? I think the first thing to unpick from that 
        knot of a question is how I will manage myself and my workload. As my strengths and 
        weaknesses are so intertwined the real trick is balance. How far down the rabbit 
        hole of creativity and inspiration do you need to go before you have sunk too far? 
        When do you take the blue pill and wake from your creative dream to get the work 
        done and when do you take the red pill and follow your creativity on its journey of 
        inspiration?</p>
      <p>The next bit to unravel is how I deal with this with other people. This really has 
        two aspects again fixated on balance.The first being internal control, the second 
        being external control. By internal control I mean the old noticing social cues 
        that are inbuilt into the very fabric of our society, knowing when you are going 
        too far with your ideas by others lack of interest. This along with a constant eye 
        on the clock coupled with an appreciation on how long each item of work takes to be 
        completed or each idea to be realised fully.</p>
      <p>The second part being external control, by this I don’t mean someone telling you 
        to “get back to work” (the absolute favourite saying of a former influence of mine 
        … and not just at me to set the record straight), no by this I mean educating 
        others I work with on what my working style is. As the personality type research 
        shows, there is only approximately 4% of the human race on the same wavelength as 
        me, leaving room for miscommunication and misinterpretation. A lot of people have 
        never met nor worked with someone like me. I get that, so I learnt a long time ago 
        that telling others what an outpouring of ideas looks like and what to do with the 
        information upfront goes along way to setting a mutual respect for each other's 
        working styles. For example a lot of people are attached to their ideas and feel 
        bad if they don’t pan out or are not well received. For me ideas are a dime a 
        dozen, so to speak, so there is not attachment, they literally an idea, food for 
        thought that can be used and expanded or discarded as needed, a notion without a 
        substantial form. I respect others attachment to their ideas, however I also try to 
        educate others that I am not attached to mine so they can do with them as they see 
        fit, that's why I told them the idea in the first place. This has obviously let my 
        ideas become something far greater than what they started as but that's the whole 
        point of an idea and I'm ok with that. It has also let my ideas be used by others 
        without credit to where they came from, again I’m ok with that (might be something 
        to the “sometimes too altruistic” weakness pointed out in last sprints blog after 
        all).</p>

      <h2 id="section5">How and where you will seek help in a timely way?</h2>
      <p>That's an easy one. Although with the remote learning aspect of the foundations 
        part of the course you are not actually alone. Your peers and the facilitators are 
        only a chatroom away. So it's not hard to ask a question when you need to. The 
        trick is when to ask a question. Well, your peers are also working hard so that has 
        to be tempered with respect to their studies.The facilitators are there and hey you 
        have really already paid for their help and that is what the resource is for. The 
        real point however is your learning, how do you improve your learning but not get 
        lost along the way? The answer is try to solve it yourself first, get specific 
        about what is your problem and search for a solution online. If you can’t be 
        specific then you're tackling too much at once so break it up into chunks and work 
        from there. If you have tried and are still stuck, then before you let frustration 
        kick in, it is time to seek help from the facilitators. Even if you feel 
        embarrassed about it just do it, that's what the resource is there for.</p>

      <h2 id="section6">What do you expect from the facilitation team?</h2>
      <p>What do I expect? Advice when I need it, the occasional checking to see how things 
        are going, and the clincher, feedback after the unobtrusive assessments are done. 
        The first two are all underway and proven to be as expected and as for the third 
        expectation, it's too early to tell. Hopefully it's forthcoming and I don’t have to 
        seek it, but it’s me and if I have to, I will.</p>

      <h2 id="section7">How will I plan my schedule?</h2>
      <p>Again an easy one, I maybe one for spontaneity however I know if it's not written 
        down it will not get done, that's just who I am. Lists and calendars are my friend. 
        Too many years using outlook in an office environment has influenced my style here 
        somewhat. I’m no slave to a single brand or software, however I do prefer to use a 
        mail client with an inbuilt calendar and task list. So unsurprisingly, that was one of 
        the first things installed on this nice new laptop I purchased for this course, and 
        yes the calendar does have blocked out time for study, child drop offs and pickups 
        etc.</p>
