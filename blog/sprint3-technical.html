      <p>
        This week's technical blog is about explaining technical terms without jargon and 
        in a non-technical friendly way. That and packing it with analogies too, so let's 
        see if mine are at least a little entertaining. 
      </p>

      <h2 id="section1">HTML and CSS what's the difference?</h2>
      <p>
        The difference between HTML and CSS is that they are responsible for different 
        parts of the website. HTML is the blueprint for the websites it's skeletal 
        structure, sure it includes a lot of the content and all its listed parts but only 
        in its rawest form. CSS on the other hand is the look. It dresses each HTML element 
        based on its instructions, think of it as your costume department manager. If we 
        try to put this into a real world idea example say you are putting on a play, HTML 
        has sourced all your actors, the set, and the script telling everyone where they 
        should be. CSS’s job is to make sure they all look the part, each actor is wearing 
        the correct costume, each set item is painted/dressed up in the correct way and so 
        forth.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section2">Control flow and loops  what are they and how do they relate to real life?</h2>
      <p>
        Control flow as the name suggests controls the flow of a program, it is the 
        sequential order that parts of the program activate for example what happens at the 
        start when it is loaded, what happens when you click this button and so on. Loops 
        are a type of function an activity of the program that does something over and over 
        until a set stopping point is reached. This is normally controlled by a conditional 
        statement and stops when the condition is no longer met kind of like  “do this 
        until it has been done for every item in this container” or in programing terms 
        for( item in container){ do this thing;}. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's put a in real life example on this idea say you are making a cup of 
        coffee. You would generally follow a process (an not the average wellingtonian 
        process of walking to the local brewista) you would first get a cup, then put in a 
        variable amount of coffee depending on taste maybe some sugar too, boil the kettle 
        until it clicks, add hot water, stir until the dry ingredients dissolve, if you are 
        so inclined ad milk. Pretty basic but this is the control flow in action. It also 
        has a few loops in it as well, such as the kettle keeps boiling until it is hot 
        enough, you keep stirring until the dry ingredients are dissolved etc.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section3">The DOM what is it? And how you might interact with it?</h2>
      <p>
        The Document Object Model or “The DOM”, is the glue that ties HTML, CSS and 
        JavaScript together. What it does in relation to HTML elements is that it creates 
        objects for each of the elements, making them into a thing that can be interacted 
        with by object oriented programing languages such as JavaScript. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To someone not technically inclined this might not sound like much so let's put it 
        in a different context. Say you are trying to assemble a flat pack bookcase (in 
        website terms say the page shows the blueprint then it morphs into the completed 
        product). You are the one actively putting it together handling the transition (the 
        animated morphing) from what you have and transforming it into what it's going to 
        be, this makes you JavaScript. Now as we touched on earlier HTML is your blueprint 
        with its list of parts and CSS is the look of the item your colour/style selection 
        in this example. Once it comes time to assemble this bookcase it's not going to get 
        very far if you physically only have a blueprint to work from and no parts to 
        assemble. That is where the DOM comes in, if you think of the DOM as the 
        manufacturer. This manufacture sits on the assembly line making the parts that will 
        then be packaged and shipped with the flatpack. How it does this is to take each of 
        the listed parts on the blueprint (the HTML elements) say a screw. It then assigned 
        properties how it looks based on the CSS instructions, say the screw (defined by 
        the HTML tag) is 20mm long and has a phillips head (CSS styles). It does this for 
        each part listed in the blueprint then the finished object is then packed and 
        shipped off. The DOM’s job is done. The animation of turning the screw and putting 
        it in place can then be handled by JavaScript, something that it couldn’t do until 
        it had an object(s) to manipulate.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section4">What is the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects?</h2>
      <p>
        Objects and arrays on their surface can seem similar as they both hold a bunch of 
        data however they are actually very different in their use. An array is more of a 
        traditional list or list of lists, holding data that can be accessed via the 
        position it takes in the list good if you know where it is but not very dynamic if 
        you have something more specific in mind. An object holds data but each piece of 
        data or value is assigned to a property or key, this giving you a key value pair. A 
        key value pair can be accessed by looking for the value or a key or any combination 
        provided it can be logically stated. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sounds confusing I know so let's put it in some context. Say you have a list of 
        people and addresses. In an array each person and address is its on sublist from 
        the original an array within an array and you need to know where each entry sits to 
        use it in a program. Say you have a person ‘bob’ who lives at ‘123 Nowhere Street’, 
        you know bob is the third person in the list so you tell the computer to pull the 
        third position and just his address which is position two then vala you have his 
        address to work with. This is fine if you have a small list and can bring it up to 
        check the position if you forget but what if your list has 1000 people in it? This 
        would be hard to remember so it would be easier to search by the property itself 
        and that's where objects come in. With an object you could search for the ‘Bob’ and 
        get his address no matter how many entries you have or where it sits within the 
        list. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Stopping here would be selling objects short they are so much more than a database 
        table, as this course progresses I’m sure we will have to explain classes at way to 
        set rules around types of objects and also methods on how the get used tying in a 
        function into the object itself, sure it still will have properties listed in key 
        value pairs but they take on a new meaning. For example say your object is a tennis 
        ball, your class says the object has a shape of spherical, has a colour dictated by 
        the object itself in this case green/yellow whatever, but this type of object has a 
        method of being thrown. Enter the classes in build function that dictates how this 
        happens. This is the basis of an object orientated programing language that allows 
        them to do almost anything in a program. 
      </p>

      <h2 id="section5">What is a function, and why are they useful?</h2>
      <p>
        A function is a piece of reusable code that does something in a program. If we go 
        back to our coffee example a function could be called makeingCoffee that provides 
        us with a cup of coffee as the end product. Within this function there are multiple 
        blocks of code that all do the different bits to at the end come together to make 
        the whole. Now let's say you wanted to make another coffee later you could redefine 
        the process and write out the code all over again but who wants to reinvent the 
        wheel over and over again. This is where the reusable part comes in, having this 
        code in a function means that it never has to be written again in the program, it 
        is all held in once place. Having it in one place as a function means the function 
        can be called on again and again but only uses the same bit of code every time it 
        is called on. It also allows it to be updated without having to find each and every 
        copy of that code wasting everyone's time. There is actually a term called WET 
        coding that refers to this last point it stands for “Write Everything Twice” or 
        “Waste Everyone’s Time” as opposed to DRY coding that means “Don’t Repeat Yourself” 
        which is preferable.
