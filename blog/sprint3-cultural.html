      <p>The cultural theme for this sprint is EQ or emotional intelligence. In it we are 
        asked to research the topic and answer the following questions.</p>

      <h2 id="section1">What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>
       
      <p>Emotional intelligence  as the dictionary meaning gose is “the capacity to be 
        aware of, control, and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal 
        relationships judiciously and empathetically.” What this means in more detail is 
        its a term for the concept of knowing oneself, how you and your actions affect 
        others as well as how you are in turn affected by others. Another way to look at it 
        as the Literary genius Dr Seuss put it:</p>
       
      <p> “So be sure when you step. Step with care and great tact and remember that Life’s 
        a Great Balancing Act. Just never forget to be dexterous and deft. And <i>never</i> 
        mix up your right foot with your left.”</p>
       
      <p>That is a quote from my favourite children's story of all time Oh, The Places 
        You’ll Go! If you never experienced this book in your childhood give it a quick 
        look, the whole book is an example of expling (in a cunning rhythmic way that is 
        Dr. Suess style.) EQ and personal resilience to a child. As life yoyos between good 
        then bad, how to pick yourself up again and continue, be it with groups and on your 
        own. It’s a cute little book</p>

      <p>Please excuse the plug at the end, it is the best rendition I could find without 
        the usual host talking “that way” towards the intended young viewers. If you are a 
        parent you know what I mean.</p>
       
      <h2 id="section2">How is it different to IQ?</h2>
       
      <p>We have touched on what Emotional Intelligence (EQ) is or Emotional Quotient if 
        you want to get letrial. To understand how this differs from Intelligence Quotient 
        (IQ) first you need to know a bit about IQ. IQ is a measure of a person's ability 
        to reason, their ability to problem solve. Whereas EQ is how we control(not 
        suppress) our own emotions and can empathise with others emotions. Both can be used 
        in a situation without the other however it would feel weird and not be an optimal 
        outcome.</p> 
       
      <h2 id="section3">Why is it important?</h2>
      
      <p>As I just mentioned an interaction with someone without either IQ or EQ would feel 
        weird and not come across as a good interaction no matter its success. To 
        demonstrate why it is important I think it's good to use a real world example where 
        both successful and unsuccessful  experiences existed with the same I level of IQ 
        but with a different emphasis on EQ.</p>
       
      <p>In this scenario I was working in an ISP helpdesk and we have a small business 
        owner that was having issues using her modem after an OS update broke the auto 
        instal for the hardwares drivers. The fix was easy after applying a little 
        knowledge and understanding. It became apparent that it was a driver issue, and the 
        best course of action was to talk the customer through manual installation, that’s 
        the IQ at work. Now that is where the similarities between the two calls ended.</p>
       
      <p>It's true that this customer had no concept of how a computer worked. It's even 
        fair to say that they hated computers. They saw them as a necessary evil to keep 
        track of the financial side of their business. In the first call the helpdesk rep 
        displayed poor emotional intelligence, and let this get to them. Their frustration 
        became so noticeable that the customer started to respond in kind. This boiled over 
        to a point where the helpdesk rep told the customer to call back when they had 
        someone with them that understood how to use a computer. As you can imagine the 
        response from the customer was enough to have the call terminated.</p>
       
      <p>Now for the second call and my turn to talk to this customer. Enraged with this 
        outcome and still needing to resolve their problem, the now irate small business 
        owner called back. From the outset they were displaying a poor sense of emotional 
        intelligence but did I let this sway how I would display my sense of emotional 
        intelligence? Well a little, I took it as an indication to display an even stronger 
        sense to try and compensate for the imbalance. First we talked about the last call 
        but not in great detail, just enough to display a little empathy and ascertain that 
        the customer felt personally insecure about their own IQ after the last call. Then 
        we talked a bit about their business followed by my own admission that I couldn’t 
        do what they do (all true, I will admit I had an advantage here being raised by 
        self-employed individuals I knew a thing or two about what doing business entailed. 
        Some aspects of self-employed life make me thankful to be an employee … well when 
        I'm employed and not a student that is). This short conversation putting the 
        situation into context helped resolve a lot of the initial stress. All it took was 
        some active listening and some honesty. We then moved on to resolve the call, it 
        was still not easy. The customer lothing of computers extended to any technical 
        jargon so the choice of language that was used had to be tailored to the audience. 
        15 years on and I still remember calling the desktop “tulips” based on the 
        wallpaper they had because it was the easiest way to talk them through it.</p>
       
      <p>So to recap in the first call both the helpdesk rep and the customer showed poor 
        emotional intelligence resulting in a negative experience. In the second call even 
        with the same level of IQ and a stronger sense of emotional intelligence it 
        resulted in a successful and positive outcome.</p> 

      <p>As it happened I was also the helpdesk soft skill coach at the time thanks to a 
        development opportunity we had running, this example became legend and a key 
        learning opportunity. I did purposely forget the name of the first help desk rep 
        from any future retellings, another use of emotional intelligence. In truth we 
        actually built a coaching relationship after that, it got to a point where they 
        were as good as me … hopefully better by now if they kept up the practice.</p>
