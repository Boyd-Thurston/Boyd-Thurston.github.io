      <p>
        For this sprint we touch on two concepts we are all familiar with even if we have 
        never used the terms listed here, these are Neuroplasticity and the Growth Mindset. 
        If you have ever done anything  with a steep learning curve, that requires lots of 
        repetition like learning to dance, or martial arts (or weapon based martial arts 
        like me) you will be on intimate terms with the concepts that these principles 
        highlight. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="section1">Neuroplasticity</h2> 
      <p>
        Neuroplasticity is a concept based around the brain (your brain, my brain, 
        everyone's brain) being a malleable organ that is constantly strengthening and 
        recycling connections between neurons.  It works by building connections and neural 
        pathways between neurons that are needed to think in a curtain way, repetition of a 
        way of thinking causes these pathways to be strengthened to make them easier to 
        follow in future. We have all heard the misnomer practice makes perfect, well it's 
        more like practice makes permanent but that in itself is a misnomer, the reality is 
        practice makes it easier to practice the same thing in the future until a point 
        where we are not using said pathway for any more or much more and it loses priority 
        at which point our brain starts to recycle the matter that makes up the pathways to 
        be moved to more commonly used pathways.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have most undoubtedly come across a time where something was hard the first 
        time but with practice you got incremental gains. Now this something is easy to do 
        and does not have to be thought of in a meaningful way as the pathway has been so 
        strengthened it is something almost unstoppable. For example when you learnt to 
        write as a kid, at first it was hard, then it got easier and easier, now you 
        probably don't think much about the act of writing, you are more concerned with the 
        content or how to coin a phrase so to speak. The same can be said for breaking down 
        a neural pathway. Have you ever thought to yourself, “wow I'm rusty at this?” when 
        you try to do something you haven't done in a long time. Sure, you remember how, 
        but the pathway has started to be recycled. It's diminished and is  more like a 
        dirt track than a super highway or it’s gone completely and you will need to build 
        it back up again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best thing about this cycle of strengthening and recycling is that you can find 
        better ways of doing things without damaging your brain or confusing yourself. 
        Think of it in terms of civil engineering: you build a super highway but find there 
        is a better route if you but a turn in here or there. Now if you added an extension 
        to allow for these turns, you have inadvertently given yourself something else to 
        think about. This would disrupt your thought process as the traffic in your brain 
        would have to get directions from somewhere. Now, if you streamlined this and 
        ripped down the sections of the super highway that were no longer needed, sure the 
        traffic now is directed without a choice, but you have left a mess in your wake not 
        to mention an environmental disaster. This is where the brain’s recycling process 
        becomes an asset. It slowly removes the not used sections until they are completely 
        reset and the environment which is your grey matter is returned to a pristine 
        state. If only civil engineers had the same ability.
      </p>
      <p>This strengthening and recycling process allows us to improve on our 
        neuroplasticity with our risk without losing out on what we have learnt by trying 
        new things. If you think of it in the concept of what I am trying to do now, 
        learning to code, then you build a super highway in the process of doing repetitive 
        exercises and build on your experience. Now what happens when a new way of doing 
        something comes to light and easier and more efficient way, you don’t just break 
        down your super highway and start again. First you try this new way and your brain 
        maps this pathway as a dirt track at first then each time you use it it adds more 
        and more matter to the build strengthening it until it itself becomes a super 
        highway. Now what happens to the old way of doing things well it's still there 
        unless it's unused. In which case it will get smaller and smaller until it is now 
        the dirt track or no longer existent at all. So in short, if you want to improve on 
        neuroplasticity don’t be afraid to try new things and repeat the experiences you 
        did like.

        One of the resources I found quite useful is this video, it highlights the 
        adaptability that is one of the main reasons for humans success. It is a bit long 
        and dry but if you are like me and like these sort of endepth documentaries it's a 
        good one.

      <h2 id="section2">The Growth Mindset</h2>
      <p>
        The growth mindset, a thing of beauty, always taking things in the not yet or 
        almost mindset sounds great but sounds a little intangible unless you also describe 
        its counterpart and complete opposite: the fixed mindset. Whereas the growth 
        mindset thinks of things in an open and optimistic way, the “I can do this!”, “I 
        will get there if I try again”, “not yet, I need to practice some more”, “maybe 
        next time”. The fixed mindset sees things as absolutes, the “I can’t do this”, “I 
        am never going to be good at…”, “why bother trying? lts not going to happen”. This 
        is not to say that the fixed mindset is necessarily bad or the growth mindset is 
        necessarily good, it's more that they both have a time and a place. Now, if you 
        were trying to cross a road for example, you would want to be in the fixed mindset. 
        A growth mindset opinion that “I’m not yet strong enough to deflect a truck, but with 
        some more practice I might.” is not going to get you far, that would call for an 
        absolute of “its a truck, you will lose”. Though if you were in a classroom 
        situation and learning a new skill, the fixed mindset of “I can’t do this so don’t 
        bother” is going to limit you before you even start, as opposed to the growth 
        mindset idea of “I don’t yet understand this but with some practice I will” is 
        going to set you up for success. How I plan on integrating this into my learning 
        journey is to use the open growth mindset example from the previous example and not 
        shoot myself in the foot before I start.

        For resources in this topic it is hard to go past the works of Dr Carol Dweck. 
        There are many websites summarising her work one of the ones I found useful was the
        <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/">mindsetworks website</a>, 
        especially if you have a chance to navigate through all its links and read the 
        works highlighted.
