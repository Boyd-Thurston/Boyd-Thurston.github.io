        In this week's sprint we were asked to practice, practice and do a little more 
        practice with JavaScript. It was focused around introducing new (or newish) 
        principles, as well as doing coding katas. Yes katas, just like martial arts but 
        with repetitive coding practice. We were then asked to share some of our personal 
        stories on this blog post so here goes!
      </p>

      <h2 id="section1">What simple problem did I get blocked on?</h2>
      <p>
        Da bees, da damn bees. It was an interesting problem taking a bunch of sentences 
        (strings for those technically minded) filled with buzz’s and removing them to 
        filter out the annoying bee sounds. I pondered over the solution for a little bit, 
        and broke it down into pieces isolating each word and creating a new sentence with 
        all words except “buzz”. All was going well but for some reason I could not get it 
        to show the result I was expecting. Then came the online research that seemed to 
        support my case, but again it still wouldn’t work. Again and again I tried and 
        failed but again and again the solutions online supported what I was doing. After 
        an hour of almost zero progress I gave up and looked up the official solution to 
        reverse engineer it and what did I find, the code was almost identical I had simply 
        missed three characters in my original attempt. Where I had a () I should have had 
        a (‘ ‘). That was it, one simple error that was causing all my issues, something I 
        missed online because I was looking for answers not an unnoticed syntax error for 
        what I was trying to achieve. Sigh.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section2">What problem did I solve in an elegant way?</h2>
      <p>
        To be honest, after a few similar errors where all it would take was another human 
        going hey, you missed a ‘ ‘ out or a ; my confidence is pretty shot. I am not sure 
        I would call any of my solutions elegant. Maybe the bees if I had noticed the ‘ ‘ 
        was missing and got it first go. As it stands, I would say my solutions were 
        passable, functional but not elegant. I may just be being over critical or 
        exhausted from the week of revolving illness (every parent knows how that goes when 
        one child brings home a bug and everyone then takes turns at being sick) but that 
        is how I feel: more frazzled and unconfident than beaming optimism to call anything 
        elegant.
      </p>

      <h2 id="section3">Reflection on techniques</h2>
      <p>
        For the last part of this week's technical blog, we were asked to state how 
        confident we feel in using a list of problem solving techniques. Working through a 
        list can read as a little dull but let's try and see how we go, please bear with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Pseudocode:</b> well it's a fine idea. State the intent of a function and how 
        it's going to work in brief written steps commented out so the don’t impact the 
        code. Personally I like the idea until I do something silly like not comment a line 
        and break everything. Easily fixed, though sometimes it seems to get in the way 
        when doing exercises like we did this week. Although from previous experience, at 
        the last institution I was at we did make a python version of battleships with the 
        added challenge of using classes for almost everything, on a project like that 
        pseudocode and comments really save the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Trying something:</b> well try and try again as I always say. Although it does 
        help to think first or quote another cliche: look before you leap. Getting stuck in 
        has never been a problem for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Rubber ducky method:</b> what an interesting methodology. Talk to yourself or an 
        inanimate object just to hear yourself explain it. Then give yourself the answer as 
        you figure out the thing you didn’t think about when it was just in your head. Who 
        ever said talking to yourself is the first sign of insanity? In programming it is 
        actively encouraged. As for me, well I am confident in this, (even if I did pester 
        the facilitator earlier and answer my own question) if you read the first sprints 
        cultural blog you may remember that I am a creative individual, as how it plays out 
        with this I could seemingly sit down have a cup of coffee and space out for a time, 
        only to come back with the answer. The reason being I can actively envision the 
        conversation without it happening. It's like popping into your own realm and 
        directing a play about the problem once you have witnessed it and come back to 
        reality, then you have effectively done the rubber ducky method without displaying 
        a little bit of crazy to everyone around you. Even if it seems slightly more crazy 
        now I’m explaining popping off to a different reality at will … let's forget that 
        bit shall we.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Reading error messages:</b> error messages are my friends. They most of the time 
        point out what I have done wrong. Just like spell check that most of the time 
        works. I think it’s just part of the joy of being dyslexic: you learn to use these 
        functions as assistive technology. The one problem with all assistive technology is 
        that it is very easy to become over reliant on it. It’s good when you need it but 
        you shouldn’t rely on it when you don’t. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Console.logging:</b> visibility is key to understanding anything, although I do 
        miss debugging programs that do that for you so you don’t need to bother commenting 
        out and uncommenting lines of code solely so you can see what one variable is set 
        to at a given time. Sadly we have not covered debugging programs yet and are still 
        learning the basics of visibility. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Googling:</b> the joy of the information revolution is that there is an answer 
        to every question somewhere online. In fact it’s more like 100,000 possible answers 
        to every question. The problem is that it is hard to know which is the best answer, 
        which actually relates to what you want, and which are just down right wrong. I am 
        still learning to quickly wade through crap and find the gems of wisdom. Even 
        forums that are normally quite good and start out on track can easily go off on a 
        tangent and never recover (like half the stack overflow posts I read). What I need 
        to do is pick up in speed of deciding what not to continue spending time reading 
        and being more precise in my original searches.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Asking for help:</b> I decided to combine the “Asking your peers for help” and 
        “Asking coaches for help” question into one as with me it's the same issue for 
        both. Sure, the facilitators are paid for recourse but I do even in my wisdom still 
        prescribe to the age old NZ adage of “She’ll be right”. I don’t know what it is 
        about this country and being stoic, I see it in others too all the time. I have 
        tried to break this mould but I still come back to it. If you happen to be one of 
        the few I have directly asked for help you now know that it took some time to even 
        get that far, even more so if it was via a messenger or the like as that message 
        was probably written and rewritten several times not to mention put through spell 
        checking at least twice. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Improving your process with reflection: I am a great one at reflecting and by that 
        I mean meaningful reflection - a little incremental process here, a lesson learned 
        there, it all adds up. I generally never make the same mistake twice or at least I 
        make a conscious effort not to, well unless I’m tired. Then I’m like a broken 
        record skipping at the same point over and over again, repeated syntax errors 
        spring to mind.
